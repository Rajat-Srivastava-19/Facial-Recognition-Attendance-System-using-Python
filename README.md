This is my Facial Recognition Attendance Management using Python project. In this project, I have used tkinter,opencv,numpy and MySql connector. I have used Haarcascade Frontal Face algorithm.<br>
The description of all the files of the project is as follows:<br>
1. main.py- This file contains code for the opening interface of the application.<br>
2. student.py- This file contains code for STUDENT ACCOUNT section. This section will contain details of various students. <br>We can save,update,delete and reset the student details in this section. In this section face capturing will also be done.<br>
3. Train.py- This file contains training dataset code. I have used Haarcascade Frontal Face algorithm.<br>
4. face_recognition.py- This file contains code for face scanning and recognition. Attendance will also be recorded in this section.<br> In this section, <u>face.csv<u> file will be created that will store attendance details with time.<br>
5. Attendance.py- This file contains code for viewing student attendance. We can import and export csv file to view and store attendance details respectively.<br>
6. face.csv- This is the file that will store attendance details of the student.<br>
7. Attendance.csv- This is the file that is created when student details are exported to save attendance details.<br><br>
This project is yet not completed and I am working on some more features. Once, I fully complete this project I will push those files as well.
